# CLTMelee-Open-Source-Project

## What is this project?
This project is a way for us, the CLTMelee TOs, to compile all of our tools, resources, and documentation as we build the future of CLTMelee tournaments. This information is free to use by anyone, including other NC TOs, OOR TOs or interested competitors just looking for info at how we put this thing together. In this repository you will find tools that we use to put on the event, stream overlays and other graphics, project boards that we use to make decisions, documentation on our different pre/during/post-event processes, and even Slippi replay files.
